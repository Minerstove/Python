1. Submit and Check Solutions in 'student_solution.py' of each folder!!

- write the code in the function given
- then run that file using 'python3 <name>.py' (the same way you run your code in WSL in labs!)


2. Do not open the folders 'OJ' unless you want to see test cases!!
3. For model solutions, look at the "model_solutions" folder outside offline judge instead. Most of the model solutions used in checking your answers are heartbreak code, so you may not understand them. The ones in the "model_solutions" folder / solutions file I'll release are more understandable !!
